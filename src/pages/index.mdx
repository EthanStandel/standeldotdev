# Welcome to standel.io

For the time being, this site should be considered a very early work in progress (WIP), and not a representation of my definition of a "final product."
To be honest, I don't know if I ever intend for this to be "production quality."
I may just end up prefering to keep it as a playground where I can "move fast and break things."

# About me

## Hi I'm Ethan!

### Professional

![Headshot](/headshot.jpeg)
I'm a fullstack developer from southern Maine currently working for DEPTÂ® as a senior software engineer.
I specialize in app performance, code readability, accessibility, and scalability for both enterprise and start-up scale applications.
I generally specialize in JavaScript (or preferably TypeScript) applications, but I also love working and building in Kotlin, Go, and Elixir.
I also love engaging with the OSS community when I know there's an idea I want to pursue or a bug I want fixed faster than I am patient!

### Personal

I'm a husband and a dad to two very beautiful pups & one absurdly handsome cat.
I also love doing shallow dives into dangerously deep hobbies like PC building, keyboard customization, VR, sim-racing, tennis, biking, hiking.
