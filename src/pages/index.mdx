# Welcome to Standel.io

You may have found this site because I either asked you to review it or something on it, or you decided to check out the domain on my email.
For the time being, this site should be considered a very early work in progress (WIP), and not a representation of my definition of a "final product."
To be honest, I don't know if I ever intend for this to be "production quality."
I may just end up prefering to keep it as a playground where I can "move fast and break things."

# About me

## Ethan Standel

![Headshot](/headshot.jpeg)
Hi, I'm Ethan!
I'm a fullstack developer from southern Maine currently working for DEPTÂ® as a senior software engineer.
I specialize in app performance, code readability, accessibility, and scalability for both enterprise and start-up scale applications.
I generally specialize in JavaScript (or preferably TypeScript) applications, but I also love working and building in Kotlin, Go, and Elixir.
I love engaging with the OSS community when I know there's an idea I want to pursue or a bug I want fixed faster than I am patient!
