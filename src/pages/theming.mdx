# Try building a custom theme for this site!

This site is built to support full custom theming on demand, mostly just using CSS variables.
The color picker is handbuilt in this repo as a SolidJS component because it seemed like a fun idea!
If you end up wanting to switch your theme back, then just uncheck this box, or use the theme-switcher in the top right to jump back to the default light/dark themes.
If you want to reset your theme back to base-dark, you can use the button at the bottom of the form.

<noscript>Sorry, this page in particular requires JavaScript to be enabled to update those CSS variables</noscript>
<CustomThemingForm client:only="solid" />
