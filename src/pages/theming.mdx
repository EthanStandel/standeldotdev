# Try building a custom theme for this site!

This site is built to support full custom theming, on demand mostly just using CSS variables.
The color picker is handbuilt in this repo as a SolidJS component because it seemed like a fun idea!

<noscript>Sorry, this page in particular requires JavaScript to be enabled to update those CSS variables</noscript>
<CustomThemingForm client:only="solid" />
