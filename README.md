# [standel.io](https://standel.io)

This site is just a fun little passion project so please don't judge it too harshly.
I chose Astro & Solid because I wanted to try some new technologies, and not necessarily because they were absolutely the best technologies for the job.
When I built [the website for my wife's business](https://cakeelizabeth.com/), I chose a slightly more sensible stack (see [the readme](https://github.com/EthanStandel/cakeelizabethdotcom#cakeelizabethcom)).
I'm using this site as a technology playground where I can deploy the "move fast and break things" mentality.

## Stack

- Framework: [`astro`](https://astro.build/)
- Dynamic components: [`solid-js`](https://www.solidjs.com/)
- Styling: [`sass`](https://sass-lang.com/)
- Content: [`@astrojs/mdx`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/mdx/)
- Streaming MPA routes: [`@hotwire/turbo`](https://turbo.hotwired.dev/)
- Comments: [`utteranc.es`](https://utteranc.es/)

Everything else (buttons, input fields, theming, animations, etc.) is hand-built!
